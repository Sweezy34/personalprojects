#post project notes:
#this project was a lot harder than I originally anticipated, lots of googling and reminding my self of previously used functions. Learned functions join() and shuffle(), reminded myself of .append
#As a side note thinking to myself, I could probably figure out if there's already a function to build the 'letters' 'numbers' and 'symbols array without having to type them out manually.
#I also could've used the upper() and lower() functions instead of typing out the alphabet twice, once with uppercase and once lowercase

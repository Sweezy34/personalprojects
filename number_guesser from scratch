#Assignment: Create a number guessing game from scratch as shown in lecture
#Must have an easy mode with 10 attempts, and a hard mode with 5 attempts
#number must be an int 1-100, num must be random
#Add comments to code for readability, also make a 'to do list'

#TODOS:
#print welcome screen, ask if easy or hard mode
#import random, have comp choose a randint between 1-100`
#print 'thinking of a num' ask player to pick 1-100
#tell player if num is higher or lower
#profit?
#probably going to have to make num of guesses a global var that will change based on difficulty

import random
from logging import fatal

#correct number will be below, i think second num is exclusive
#add global variable of correct number
COR_NUM = random.randrange(1,101)
print(COR_NUM)

#function tells player if guess is greater or less than COR_NUM or if correct, quits
def guess(num):
    while num:
        if int(num) > COR_NUM:
            print("Nope, the number is lower than your guess")
        elif int(num) < COR_NUM:
            print("Nope, the number is higher than your guess")
        elif int(num) == COR_NUM:
            print(f"{num} is the correct answer!")
            quit()
        else:
            print("Enter a valid input.")

#Create number of guesses var
guesses = 0

#init
print("Welcome to the number guessing game.\n")


#code below assigns guesses var to be 5 or 10
#create var choice which loops the code below until correct input

choice = True
while choice:

    # asks player input easy or hard
    mode = input("Easy or Hard mode?\n")

    if mode == "Easy".lower():
        guesses = 10
        choice = False
    elif mode == "Hard".lower():
        guesses = 5
        choice = False
    else:
        print("Enter a valid input")

print(f"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100, you have {guesses} guesses!")

while guesses > 0:
    player_guess = input()
    guess(player_guess)
    guesses -= 1
    print(f"You have {guesses} guesses left!")

    if player_guess == COR_NUM:
        print("You guessed it! Congrats!")
        quit()

if guesses <= 0:
    print(f"Sorry, looks like you ran out, the number was {COR_NUM}")
    quit()
